# Curriculum

# Curriculum Philosophy

- **Hands-On First, Theory Second:** Each topic starts with a tangible problem or interactive simulation. Theory and math are introduced as essential tools to understand why something works, not as abstract concepts.
- **Spiral Curriculum:** Concepts are revisited at increasing levels of depth and complexity each year.
- **Bangladeshi Context:** Projects and examples are rooted in local scenarios, challenges, and available components.
- **Semester Structure:** Each academic year has two semesters. A student could take one track per semester or follow one track for the entire year, depending on school resources and student interest.
